    <h1>Morse code</h1>
      
    <p>For our final project, our prototype will be about teaching people the wonders of Morse code, something that
    was monumentally imporant during World War 2 which has affected us all in some way. Users will learn how to 
    send messages encoded in Morse as well as some of the history behind the development of it. It will be an
    interactive exhibit using the Arduino micro-processor. The user will be able to push buttons which will transmit
    a signal to the computer which will then display a message. The design would fit in the Exploratorium through
    its physical interactivity. </p>

    <p>There is a lot of information online and there are translators but we hope to make this a fun exhibit by 
    bringing in the tactile experience. </p>
    
    <ol>Easy version - 
      <ul>*translates user input and displays on computer </ul>
      <ul>*two buttons on Arduino, one for a "dot" and one for a "dash"</ul>
    </ol>
      
    <ol>Clever version - 
      <ul>*one button on Arduino, short press for a "dot" and long press for a "dash"</ul>
      <ul>*takes user to a interactive fiction type story about the history of Morse code</ul>
      <ul>*Arduino outputs sound when user inputs "dots" and "dashes"</ul>
    </ol>
      
    <ol>Advanced version - 
      <ul>*user interface interacts with the computer</ul>
      <ul>*the input is simutaneously translated as it is registered</ul>
      <ul>*you can choose to link your messages through social media and raise awareness about Morse code</ul>
    </ol>

      <u1>Edits - 
        7/30/2014 ; We realized that syncronizing input between the Arduino and the PC would be a challenge and 
        we don't think that we have enough time so we have modified our plans. The Arduino now hosts 3 buttons
        (dot/dash/space) which all light up an LED when pressed. We plan on storing user input as an array which 
        will then play back how the Morse code sounds through the buzzer.
