    For our final project, our prototype will be about teaching people the wonders of Morse code, something that
    was monumentally imporant during World War 2 which has affected us all in some way. Users will learn how to 
    send messages encoded in Morse as well as some of the history behind the development of it. It will be an
    interactive exhibit using the Arduino micro-processor. The user will be able to tap pieces of aluminum foil
    which will transmit a signal to the computer which will then display a message. The design would fit in the 
    Exploratorium through its physical interactivity.

    There is a lot of information online and there are translators but we hope to make this a fun exhibit by 
    bringing in the tactile experience. 
    
    Easy version - 
      *translates user input and displays on computer
      *two buttons on Arduino, one for a "dot" and one for a "dash"
      
    Clever version - 
      *translates user input and displays on computer
      *two buttons on Arduino, one for a "dot" and one for a "dash"
      *takes user to a interactive fiction type story about the history of Morse code
      *Arduino outputs sound when user inputs "dots" and "dashes"
      
    Advanced version -
